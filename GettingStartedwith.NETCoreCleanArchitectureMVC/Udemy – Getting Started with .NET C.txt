Udemy – Getting Started with .NET Clean Architecture (Single Entity Focus)

This project is an implementation of Clean Architecture using .NET, based on the Udemy course
“Getting Started with .NET Core Clean Architecture”.
The goal of the project is to deeply understand layered separation, MediatR, and command handling, applied to one entity only for clarity and focus.

Architecture Overview

The solution follows Clean Architecture with 8 layers, ensuring loose coupling, high cohesion, and testability.

1. Domain Layer

Contains core domain entities (models).

Defines repository interfaces (no implementations).

Includes Commands and Command Handlers definitions related to the domain.

Completely independent of infrastructure and frameworks.

2. Domain.Core Layer

Contains the Mediator handler interface abstraction.

Defines Domain Events.

Includes a shared abstract Command base class used across the system.

Acts as the core communication contract between layers.

3. Application Layer

Contains application logic only (no infrastructure concerns).

Includes:

Services (interfaces & implementations).

DTOs / ViewModels.

Mapping logic between ViewModels, Commands, and domain models.

Responsible for orchestrating use cases and business workflows.

4. Infrastructure.Data Layer

Contains DbContext and Entity Framework migrations.

Implements repository interfaces defined in the Domain layer.

Handles all database-related operations using EF Core.

5. Infrastructure.Bus Layer

Contains the implementation of the Mediator handler.

Responsible for sending commands to MediatR and dispatching them to the correct handlers.

Acts as the messaging bridge between Application and Domain logic.

6. Infrastructure.IoC Layer

Centralized dependency injection container.

Registers:

DbContext

Repositories

Services

Commands & Command Handlers

MediatR

AutoMapper

Ensures clean startup configuration and dependency resolution.

7. API Layer

Contains thin controllers (no business logic).

Exposes REST endpoints.

Delegates all work to the Application layer.

Program.cs configures:

EF Core connection

MediatR

Swagger

Dependency Injection

8. MVC (UI) Layer

Acts as a client application to consume and test the API.

Contains:

MVC Controllers

Razor Views

Focused on UI rendering and user interaction only.

ASP.NET Identity is scaffolded here, so Identity and its DbContext live in the MVC project.

This was done intentionally to keep the Clean Architecture flow focused on Mediator and Commands.

Request Flow (Create Entity Example)

User sends a request from the MVC UI.

MVC controller calls the API endpoint.

API controller calls the Application Service.

The service maps the ViewModel (DTO) to a Command object
(CreateEntityCommand) using a constructor to enforce required data.

The command is sent through the Bus layer, which forwards it to MediatR.

MediatR resolves the correct
IRequestHandler<CreateEntityCommand>.

The command handler:

Maps the command data to a domain entity (manual mapping).

Uses the repository to persist data.

Saves changes to the database.

Control returns back through the layers to the UI.

Notes

Mediator pattern is the main focus of this project.

Identity is scaffolded only for authentication support and not part of the Clean Architecture flow.

A testing video is included to demonstrate the end-to-end request lifecycle.
